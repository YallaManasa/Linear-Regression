Simple_linear_Regression:

the algorithm assumes thelinear relationship between 2 variables.

*input(x) variable is called as independent variable,output(y) is called as a dependent variable.

*Where the data is in continuous value

x=1 2 3 4 5=15 x^=3 y=1 2 34 5=15 y^=3 (15-3)(15-3)/15-3=1212/12=1

The formula of linear regression can be given as Y=mx+c

*Y=Dependent variable.

*x=Independent variable.

*m= slope of regression line.

*c=intercept

When there is a single continuous dependent variable and a single independent variable ,the analysis is called a simple linear Regression analysis.

*To find the linear relationship between x,y we can use mean of x and y we can use the formula y=mx+c

*we need to find slope m by using formula

m=sum(x-x^)(y-y^)/sum(x-x^)2

x=independent variable

x^=x_bar(mean of x variable)

y=dependent variable

y^=y_bar(mean of y)

*The ordinary least Squares method plays a main role to over come all the errors.

** Steps to build the model**

*Step_1: Loading the data

*Step_2: Loading Required Libraries.

*step_3:EdA

*step_4:Training the Model

Step_5:Testing the Model

Step_6:Making the predictions using r2_score,mean square error.

step_7: plottting the graph.
